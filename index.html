                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This project is an interactive report created using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales data from AdventureWorks. AdventureWorks is a fictional company often used for training and demonstrating business analytics software. This report is designed to help stakeholders understand various aspects of the company's sales, from a high-level summary to detailed analyses based on different criteria. The report is divided into four first menus, each containing several second menus, providing a comprehensive and interactive view of sales data.</p>

              <h2>Project Description</h2>
              <p>This project aims to develop a dynamic sales dashboard for the executive team of a retail company, specifically focusing on a fictional bike store dataset. The primary approach involves leveraging relevant data from the company's database using SQL and designing a well-structured, dynamic dashboard using Tableau..</p>
              <br>
              <p>The first step involves querying the company's relational database using SQL scripts to generate detailed datasets from the bike store's sales, inventory, and customer data. These datasets will provide all the necessary information required to compile a dynamic sales dashboard for the executive team.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Subsequently, I will import the generated datasets from SQL. These datasets will be linked to Tableau using Excel sheets containing SQL output data. Utilizing this data, the goal is to create a visually appealing and dynamic dashboard that effectively communicates sales performance metrics, inventory insights, customer trends, and other key metrics specific to the bike store.</p>
              <br>
              <p>This project is expected to provide added value by enhancing understanding of the bike store's sales performance and operational efficiency, supporting more informed decision-making by the executive team.</p>

                  <p>The report titled "My World Happiness Demo" uses a world map to visualize happiness scores across different countries. The report focuses on Europe and uses colors to denote the happiness score for each country. The countries in Europe with higher happiness scores are displayed in shades of blue, while countries with lower happiness scores are depicted in shades of green. The report aims to visually represent the happiness index across Europe. It is worth noting that the data for this report is incomplete, as only countries in Europe and Asia are represented on the map. The report could be improved by including data from all countries in the world for a more complete understanding of global happiness.</p>
